I'm getting excited. Tomorrow afternoon I hop on my plane for San Jose and [WWDC](wwdc). Last year was my first WWDC, and I was lucky enough to make it through the ticket lottery again this year. I had an amazing time and learned a ton last year, but I regret not taking notes about what I did and the people I met. I've set up this blog hoping to solve that this year.

I've packed all my clothes and plugged in my devices for some overnight charging. This time tomorrow I'll be in San Jose. Maybe out watching the Warriors game somewhere.
