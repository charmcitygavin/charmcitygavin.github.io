Hi! I'm Gavin. I'm from Baltimore, Maryland. I make music and things with code, including an upcoming iOS app called Small Moments, a streaming video service for music videos I make. You can check out Small Moments on [Vimeo][sm-vimeo] and [Instagram][small-moments-ig] to get a feel for the vibe. I'm shooting for a June 14th release, so keep an eye here and on [my Twitter][twitter] for updates. I'm really excited about it. It's a chance for me to combine some of the things I love most: making music, shooting short movies, and programming. If you want to beta test it, [drop me a line][email] and I'll add you.
